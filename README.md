# Huffmans-code

This Python project implements Huffman Coding, a lossless data compression algorithm, along with a visualization of the Huffman Tree using NetworkX and Matplotlib. The program allows users to input data as a string or manually specify character frequencies, computes the Huffman Tree, generates optimal binary codes for each character, and visualizes the tree structure. Key features include interactive input handling, tree construction using a priority queue (min-heap), and a graphical representation of the tree with labeled nodes and edges. This project demonstrates an efficient approach to data compression and provides a clear visualization of the encoding process.
